This code implements a simple stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure includes a display area for the time, control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap), and a section to show recorded lap times. CSS styles center the stopwatch on the page and give it a clean, modern appearance. The JavaScript logic manages the stopwatch functionality: starting, pausing, resetting, and recording lap times. It uses `setInterval` to update the displayed time every second, calculates elapsed time, and dynamically updates the DOM with the current time and lap entries. Overall, the code combines interactive elements with time management to create a functional stopwatch.
